# Cardless ATMs (General Guide)

Cardless ATMs allow you to withdraw cash without inserting a physical debit card. Instead, you verify your identity using a mobile banking app, digital wallet, or temporary access code.

## What is a cardless ATM?
A cardless ATM is an ATM that supports cash withdrawals using:

- Mobile banking app authentication  
- QR code scanning  
- NFC tap-to-withdraw (digital wallet)  
- One-time withdrawal codes  

This can be useful if you forget your wallet or want added security.

## How cardless withdrawals work
Most banks that offer cardless ATM access follow a process like:

1. Open your bank’s mobile app  
2. Select “Cardless ATM” or “Withdraw Cash”  
3. Generate a temporary code or QR scan  
4. Use the ATM to complete the withdrawal  

The code usually expires within a few minutes.

## Benefits of cardless ATMs
