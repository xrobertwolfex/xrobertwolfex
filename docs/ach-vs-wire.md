# ACH Transfers vs Wire Transfers (General Guide)

ACH transfers and wire transfers are two common ways to move money between bank accounts. While both methods send funds electronically, they differ in speed, cost, and how they are processed.

## What is an ACH transfer?
ACH stands for Automated Clearing House. ACH transfers are commonly used for:

- Direct deposit payroll
- Recurring bill payments
- Bank-to-bank transfers
- Peer-to-peer payments (in some cases)

ACH transfers are processed in batches through the ACH network.

### Typical ACH timing
ACH transfers usually take:

- **1–3 business days**
- Longer over weekends or holidays

ACH is generally low-cost or free for consumers.

## What is a wire transfer?
A wire transfer is an electronic payment sent directly between banks. Wire transfers are often used for:

- Large transactions
- Real estate closings
- International payments
- Time-sensitive transfers

Wire transfers are processed individually rather than in batches.

### Typical wire transfer timing
Wire transfers are often:

- Same-day (domestic)
- 1–2 days (international)

Wire transfers usually come with higher fees.

## Key differences between ACH and wire transfers

- **Speed:** Wires are typically faster than ACH  
- **Cost:** ACH is usually cheaper or free, wires often have fees  
- **Reversibility:** ACH payments may sometimes be reversible, wires are difficult to reverse  
- **Use cases:** ACH is common for everyday banking, wires are used for urgent or high-value transfers  

## Which one should you use?
Choose ACH transfers when:

- You are not in a rush
- You want lower fees
- You are sending routine payments

Choose wire transfers when:

- Timing is critical
- You are sending a large amount
- The recipient requires a wire (such as for closing costs)
