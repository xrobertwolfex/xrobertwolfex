# Deposit Holds (Funds Availability Overview)

A deposit hold is a temporary delay before money from a check or deposit becomes available in your bank account. Holds are common and are often used to reduce fraud risk and ensure deposits clear properly.

## What is a deposit hold?
A deposit hold means your bank has accepted a deposit, but some or all of the funds are not immediately available to withdraw or spend.

Deposit holds may apply to:

- Paper checks
- Mobile check deposits
- Large deposits
- New accounts
- Deposits from unfamiliar sources

## Why banks place holds on deposits
Banks place holds for several reasons, including:

- Verifying the check is legitimate
- Preventing overdrafts or fraud
- Confirming funds are received from the issuing bank
- Managing risk on large or unusual deposits

Holds are especially common when a deposit is larger than your typical activity.

## How long do deposit holds last?
Hold times vary by bank, but common timeframes include:

- **1–2 business days** for many standard deposits
- **Up to 5–7 business days** for larger or higher-risk checks
- Longer holds for new accounts or repeated returned checks

Weekends and federal holidays can delay availability.

## How to check when funds will be available
Most banks provide deposit availability information through:

- Mobile banking apps (deposit status)
- Online banking transaction details
- Deposit receipts at branches or ATMs
- Customer support

Some banks will show an “available on” date for held deposits.

## How to reduce deposit hold issues
To avoid unexpected delays:

- Deposit checks early in the day
- Use direct deposit when possible
- Ask your bank about funds availability policies
- Maintain consistent account history and balances

For urgent needs, consider speaking with your branch directly.
