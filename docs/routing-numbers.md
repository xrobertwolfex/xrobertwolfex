# Routing Numbers (General Overview)

Routing numbers are 9-digit codes used to identify banks and credit unions in the United States. They help ensure payments and transfers are sent to the correct financial institution.

## What is a routing number?
A routing number (also called an ABA routing number) is used for processing transactions such as:

- Direct deposit
- ACH transfers
- Bill payments
- Wire transfers (in some cases)
- Check processing

Each routing number is tied to a specific bank or credit union.

## ACH routing number vs wire routing number
Some banks use different routing numbers depending on the type of transfer:

- **ACH routing numbers** are used for electronic transfers like direct deposit and bill pay
- **Wire routing numbers** may be different and are used for domestic or international wire transfers

Always confirm the correct routing number for your transaction type.

## Where to find your routing number
You can usually locate your routing number in several places:

- The bottom left of a paper check
- Your bank’s mobile app or online banking portal
- Your bank’s direct deposit instructions
- Customer support or official bank documentation

## Why banks may have multiple routing numbers
Large banks sometimes have multiple routing numbers based on:

- The state where you opened your account
- The bank’s internal processing region
- Specific services (ACH vs wire)

This is common with national banks that operate across many states.

## Tips for using the correct routing number
To avoid payment delays or rejected transfers:

- Double-check whether you need ACH or wire routing details
- Use official bank sources whenever possible
- Confirm routing numbers before sending large payments
