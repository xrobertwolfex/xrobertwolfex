# ATM Fees (General Guide)

ATM fees are charges that may apply when you withdraw cash, check balances, or use an ATM outside your bank’s network.

## What are ATM fees?
ATM fees are usually made up of two possible charges:

- **Out-of-network fee** from your bank  
- **Operator surcharge** from the ATM owner  

Some withdrawals may include both fees.

## When do ATM fees apply?
ATM fees are most common when:

- You use an ATM outside your bank’s network  
- You withdraw cash internationally  
- Your account does not include fee reimbursements  

In-network ATMs are often free.

## How to avoid ATM fees
Common ways to reduce or avoid fees include:

- Use your bank’s ATM locator  
- Withdraw cash at in-network machines  
- Choose banks that reimburse ATM fees  
- Get cash back at retail checkout when available
